  <li> Exxon Research: Deblending Seismic Signals </li>

<ul> <li> Description: This is a project posed to us by senior researcher Yanhua Yuan at Exxon Research and engineering company. We investigate the problem of denoising two seismic signals. Imagine we simulate two sesimic signals originating at two different location and starting at different time. At some point, the signals will collide. The question is how can we recover one of the signals?  </li> </ul>

  <li> Libor Rates Prediction  </li>

  <ul> <li> Description: This is a project posed to us by the Institute for Mathematics and its applications at University of Minessota. We examine a large data set consisting of libor rates from year 2014-2018 and we investigate whether Christmas has a negative or positive effect on the libor rates. </li> </ul>

  <li> X-ray Classification of healthy and infected patients  </li>

<ul> <li> Description: We have a very large data set (1GB) consisting of x-rays belonging to healthy and infected patients. By infection, we mean the patients have Pneumonia. We perform data analysis on the data set using two methods: Support Vector Machines using Histogram of Oriented Gradients and Convolutional Neural Networks. </li> </ul>

  <li> Youtubers' Popularity Dataset  </li>

<ul> <li> Description: Machine learning project (ongoing). As a frequent user of Youtube, one of the questions I've always wondered is what makes certain Youtubers successful. Is this a function of the number of videos uploaded, the number of subscribers, or the number of viewers? In this project, we investiage this.  </li> </ul>

Hi, welcome! I am Anthony Nguyen and am currently in my 5th (final) year of my PhD program in Applied Mathematics at the <a href="https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/">University of California, Davis</a>. I work with Professor <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/kriznakumar/home"> Krishna Balasubramanian </a> (PhD advisor) on designing stochastic algorithms and analyzing their convergence properties. 

To contact me, feel free to email me at antngu [at] ucdavis [dot] edu. For academic related inquiries, email me at anthonynguyen [at] math [dot] ucdavis [dot] edu.

Hi, welcome! I am Anthony Nguyen and recently obtained my PhD in Applied Mathematics at the <a href="https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/">University of California, Davis</a>. Previously, I worked with Professor <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/kriznakumar/home"> Krishna Balasubramanian</a> on designing stochastic algorithms and analyzing their convergence properties. 

<b>I am looking for full-time opportunities in software engineering and data science. Contact me if there is an opportunity!</b>

To contact me, feel free to email me at antngu [at] ucdavis [dot] edu.
